#Star Wars Game to Aid Spasticity Therapy

## Project Purpose

I created this project to help my disabled brother continue his occupational therapy at home. He has spasticity in his right hand and should be actively moving it continuously
throughout the day. Due to his condition he never moves it and does not stick to the typical opening and closing of his hand exercises which he was given because it seems like a chore to him. I made this game and controller as a fun way for him to stick to his hand excercises without getting bored.

## Project Description

This game is a 2D shooter which is based on the scene in Star Wars when Luke meets the jawas.
The game is played with a device which fits over the right hand and two buttons for the left hand.
A flexi sensor is fitted to the right hand part of the device for the fire button.

When the program is opened a start screen appears with the Star Wars theme tune.

When the right hand is opened a get ready screen appears for about 3 seconds.

Now the first level begins. The goal is to shoot the Jawas until they are all defeated. If a Jawa is missed then its game over and the player must start again. Two buttons are used to steer the racer left and right and the right hand must open to fire a bullet.

## Final Note
I created one level of this game to test my brothers' reaction to the system and determine whether I should continue with the full project. I showed him one level and he was very enthusiastic about it so I will continue to improve the game and add more levels.
